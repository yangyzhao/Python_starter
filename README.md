# Python_starter
The Python package for a starter

This file is a Python script, going through the most important bascis for using Python in the world of oceanographic research.
It is meant to help students and scientists unfamiliar with Python as a Progamming Language. Rather than a complete and official introduction, it is kept rather informal and leaves out lots of details. It is just intended to get the target group started.
